        <div class=introtext>
            <p> Born in 1980 in Prague, Petr Bakla often employs basic pitch-based material (typically the chromatic and the whole-tone scales) in his compositions. He is interested in constructing situations and structural contexts in which these frugal musical elements can acquire a unique expressiveness and energy. A frequent feature of Bakla's work is a simultaneous course of two musical/sound layers which, although usually markedly differing in dynamics to allow for a sense of "figure and background", are not mutually subordinating - they are of equal importance, their "friction" creating specific tension and ambiguity.</p></div><br>
        <div class=introtext1> 
            <p2>Bakla's music has been performed in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Armenia, Ukraine and the United States (NYC, Boston, San Diego ao), in many cases commissioned and/or performed by distinguished musicians. Of special importance has been the collaboration with the Ostrava Center for New Music.</p2></div><br>
        <div class=introtext2> <p3>Petr Bakla studied music at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, took part in several composition courses and workshops home and abroad and was awarded scholarships and residencies. He is self-taught.</p3></div><br><br>

                <p21>In 2019 and 2020, I finally finished Portfolio, a piano piece that had been announcing its arrival for over ten years and whose principle essentially permeates everything I have ever written. It is also present in my Piano Concerto No. 2 – at first sight significantly and clearly, though in reality, the relationship is relatively distant and intricate (realizing this was one of the crucial moments during my work on the concerto).<br> At around the same time, at the Ostrava Days festival 2019, I also met Miroslav Beinhauer. His rendition of my solo piano piece No. 4 took my breath away, and since then, our collaboration has continued intensively, to my great joy (Miroslav recordef Portfolio, mentioned above, and another piece, for a CD hot off the press). So when I discovered last summer that the new piece I had begun planning was quickly turning into a piano concerto, I was not very surprised.</p21><br>

            <p23>A place we repeatedly want to return to without any practical need is, by definition, a place of pilgrimage.
                Coming up with a practical reason for writing music is difficult (this is certainly so in my case), and as with anyone else, what I have once discovered in music (where I was) has a tendency to recur in some form (I return).<br> There Is an Island Above The City consists of three parts, with the length of the first two approximately corresponding to the length of the third. It may be said that I am approaching a place of pilgrimage from two directions.</p23><br><br>

            <p23>When Pavel Šnajdr, the conductor of the BCO, asked me a few words to "promote" the ordered song, which premiered tonight - and he wanted it fast - I wrote: "Listen as if you were watching the clouds - let 's say that the winter clouds; it flies fast and you have a distant view and a moment of time. Don't imagine it, just please listen. " I've always felt that one should be careful and taciturn in these respects, after all, why the author's secondary feelings should be important at all can do more harm than good. But if I missed it that way, I'll add Elsewhere is related to the second part of my orchestral composition Classical blend / Weihnachtsoratorium and to String Trio No. 2 , and that I wrote all three compositions at the turn of autumn and winter. And that they are unmistakably related, even though each originated in a quite different way, not to mention the diversity of the operating apparatus.<br> Elsewhere then it reflects my in turn a deepening need (and dislike and also an inability) to interfere in the music in any "staging" way, (de) to shape it from the outside, so to speak. Now I haven't used the necessary friction between the quiet and the loud for so many years, and I chase musicians with demands that everything always sound the same, that the tones don't start and end with the usual articulation, and prescribe them meaningless dynamics like mp and poco f - because I think that the thing is most interesting when it is as much as possible itself, and that only when we deliberately try to keep everything unchanged and flat can the real,The name can mean "somewhere", but also "somewhere".</p23><br><br>

            <p24>The most important instruction for the players in the score (and there are hardly two more) reads: “Objective,
                pure sound”. The music text itself is bare rhythm and pitch, plus some rather subtle and evenly distributed
                dynamic marks – there are lots of them across the piece, but their aim is clearly different form the usual creation of expressive gestures.
<br>
                I find that the principal sound of acoustic instruments, devoid of any-century interpretational stereotypes and masterfully controlled by great performers, is the most exciting and the most luxurious material I can work with now (much more so than any electronic sound, for example) . For better or worse, my music has little use for anything else anyway. If I ever had a credo, it might be: “Don't try to make your music more interesting than it actually is. You won't help anything."
<br>
                The above description fits to pretty much all my pieces dating from roughly last 7 years. In today's new music environment, the appearance of my scores has repeatedly produced some moments of astonishment, embarrassment and more or less explicit prejudice (one conductor thought I had sent him a pre-definitive score by mistake, because there were no crescendo/ decrescendo marks and “not enough articulations”). No such thing happened, however, with ensemble recherche, new music protagonists of first grade, and I'm very happy to have the piece premiered by them this evening.</p24>
